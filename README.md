# hello-world
I am completely new to the coding world. I have an interest in computers always have just never followed what I should have in my career choices.  So this is my way to a fresh start in finding myself and what I really want to do in my life.

  I currently have an associates degree in business management with a minor in criminal justice.  I work in the water and sewer field which includes but not limited to main breaks, service leaks, sewer back ups, storm water drainage, julie markings, and snow removal. Its a good job with good pay and a great benefit/retirement package.  Even though I like it. I do not love the job. My heart and soul is just not in it. I crave for something more.
